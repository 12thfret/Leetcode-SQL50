Table: Activity

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| machine_id     | int     |
| process_id     | int     |
| activity_type  | enum    |
| timestamp      | float   |

The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
 

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.

Answer:
SELECT machine_id , ROUND (avg(time_taken), 3) as processing_time 

FROM (
SELECT a1.machine_id , a1.process_id, (a2.timestamp - a1.timestamp) as time_taken
FROM Activity a1 
CROSS JOIN Activity a2
WHERE a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id AND 
a1.process_id = a2.process_id AND 
a1.activity_type = 'start' AND a2.activity_type = 'end') as c1

GROUP by machine_id
